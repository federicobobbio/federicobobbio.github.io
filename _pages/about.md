I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Operations Research at Université de Montréal, where I work with [Margarida Carvalho](http://margaridacarvalho.org). 

Before joining [CERC](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/) and [CHAIRE](http://margaridacarvalho.org/chair.html) for my Ph.D., I was research assistant of [Pierpaolo Battigalli](https://dec.unibocconi.eu/people/pierpaolo-battigalli) on the project "Reasoning About Strategic Interaction and Emotions". 

I completed my Master in Theoretical Mathematics graduating cum laude. In my Thesis, written under the supervision of [Alessandro Berarducci](https://people.dm.unipi.it/berardu/), I explored the connection between Logic and Strategic Reasoning. For the purpose of my research I visited [Johan van Benthem](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.vanbenthem/). 


Currently my interests are focused at the intersection of Matching Theory, Mathematical Optimization and Computational Complexity. With a group of friends we participated in the [AI for TSP Competition](https://www.tspcompetition.com/) (first place), and I led the group at the [MIP 2022 Computational Competition](https://www.mixedinteger.org/2022/competition/) (Outstanding student submission).
