I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Operations Research at Université de Montréal, where I work with [Margarida Carvalho](http://margaridacarvalho.org). 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant on the project "Reasoning About Strategic Interaction and Emotions" led by [Pierpaolo Battigalli](https://dec.unibocconi.eu/people/pierpaolo-battigalli). 
I completed my Master in Theoretical Mathematics graduating with summa cum laude. In my Thesis, written under the supervision of [Alessandro Berarducci](https://people.dm.unipi.it/berardu/), I explored the connection between Logic and Strategic Reasoning. 

I have been co-organizing the [Decision Science for Decision Making coffee talks](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/coffee/), focusing on works at the intersection of game theory, mathematical optimization, and machine learning. 
This year I am also honored to serve as the treasurer of [EAAMO 2023](https://eaamo.org/) conference, which aims to highlight works in algorithmic, optimization, and mechanism design that help improve equity and access.

## **Research interests**:
