I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [CERC DS4DM](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Operations Research at Université de Montréal (excellence mention), having had the tremendous fortune of receiving guidance from [Margarida Carvalho](http://margaridacarvalho.org). 

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant on the project "Reasoning About Strategic Interaction and Emotions" led by [Pierpaolo Battigalli](https://dec.unibocconi.eu/people/pierpaolo-battigalli). 
I completed my Master in Theoretical Mathematics (summa cum laude) at the University of Pisa. In my Thesis, written under the supervision of [Alessandro Berarducci](https://people.dm.unipi.it/berardu/), I explored the connection between Logic and Strategic Reasoning. 

I have been co-organizing the [Decision Science for Decision Making coffee talks](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/coffee/), focusing on works at the intersection of game theory, mathematical optimization, and machine learning. 

## **Research interests**:
Matching theory, mathematical optimization, game theory and computational complexity.
