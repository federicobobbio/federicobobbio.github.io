Aeroplan is one of the biggest loyalty programs in Canada with more than five million
members. In exchange for their participation in the program the members are offered miles each time
they make purchases from the Aeroplan partners. Those miles can then be used by the members as an
alternative currency allowing them to buy a variety of products and services offered by the pool of
partners. The purpose of our work within the The Ninth Montreal Industrial Problem Solving Workshop was
to develop a methodology for optimizing the design elements of the loyalty program, i.e., maximizing
profitability of the program and its attractiveness and value for its members over the long term. Our
teamâ€™s goal was to build a conceptual model that would integrate key program dynamics in a game
theory framework.
